**Midnight transmission** is a 2D top-down exploration game about a surreal interconnected world; explore abstract and absurd areas collecting tools that can change the environment or improve exploration. <br>
The game was developed in Godot with GDScript by a team of **three core developers** and a small team of **collaborative developers**. The unique visual style comes from how much we've capitalised on the game as a collaborative effort, using composers, artists, and developeers with a wide range of aesthetics.

See [Game](#the-game) for information about the game itself, and [Development](#development) for information about my development on the project.

You can play the game at the Itch.io website linked below:

In Midnight Transmission you play as **Toby**, crawling through his TV and exploring an interconnected universe of worlds. Each world has its own **story to tell and secrets to discover**, and the focus of the game is exploring the branching routes.

Midnight Transmission is a **Yume Nikki fangame**, a genre of games inspired by the 2004 RPG Maker game [Yume Nikki](https://store.steampowered.com/app/650700/Yume_Nikki/), which is where the basis of the mechanics and aesthetics comes from. However, this game takes many liberties that other projects don't, notably the use of 3D rendering for the player character and the lack of tile-based movement, distinguishing the project with a more modern twist. Inspiration was taken from several [YNFGs](https://ynfg.yume.wiki/Yume_Nikki_Fangames_Wiki), such as [Yume 2kki](https://ynoproject.net/2kki/)'s collaborative development, and [Collective Unconscious](https://ynoproject.net/unconscious/)'s aesthetic style.

Waking in a panopticon of TVs, there are **7 'starting' worlds to choose from**, each leading to more worlds and creating an explorative spiders web; some pathways are only one-way, or require unlocking from only one side, adding a sense of progression to exploration. Alongside this are **effects to collect**, tools to change the environment or ease progression, such as the *racecar effect* that gives the player a massive speed boost but tank controls, or the *fracture effect* that gives the player a 'checkpoint' they can place down and return to at will, solving problems with one-way paths. In the most recent version of the game (0.3.0) there are **40+ worlds to explore and 7 effects to collect**.
